# Lost-in-the-Woods---Epic-Odyssey-to-Reunite

While adventuring too far from his crew, our protagonist got lost and now needs to find his way back to his friends! 
Before he can do that, he needs to gather some materials to build a tower so he can communicate with them again, but he's not alone in the woods as there are a lot of weird creatures around...

Solve puzzles, gather coins to upgrade your stuff, and learn ancient forms of magical powers to help you on your journey!
